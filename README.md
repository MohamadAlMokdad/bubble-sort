# 🔄 Bubble Sort

This Python function implements the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an array in ascending order. Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the array, comparing adjacent elements, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the array is sorted.

## 📜 Function: `bubble_sort`

### 📝 Description
The `bubble_sort` function iterates through the array multiple times. During each iteration, it compares each pair of adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Each iteration "bubbles up" the largest unsorted element to its correct position. The algorithm continues until all elements are sorted.

# Sample array
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
#output=[11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
